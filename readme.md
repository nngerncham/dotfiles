# Dotfiles

The dotfiles contains the configurations and templates for a handful of things that I use quite often.

In `dotconfig/`, you can will find the config files I use for

- `alacritty`, the terminal I use in Linux
- `fish`, my choice of shell
- `helix`, a terminal-based text editor I use when I feel funky (mainly just for Go)
- `i3`, my choice of desktop environment on Linux, modified from the base EndeavorOS i3 config
- `lvim`, config for LunarVim which I use in place of Neovim due to laziness **Need to install LunarVim yourself!!**
- `nvim`, config for Neovim - I don't really use it anymore
- `starship`, something I run on top of Fish for pretty terminals :D
- `tmux`, tmux stuff :p

In `latex_templates/`, you will find the base templates for $\LaTeX$ that I use. It will eventually have one for notes/homeworks and one for presentations with Beamer.

In `layouts/`, you will find the layouts I use for [Tmuxifier](https://github.com/jimeh/tmuxifier).

In `slide_deck_templates/`, you will find the files I use for making slide decks with [Marp](https://marp.app/).

In `tohome/`, you will find a few config files that belongs in the home directory instead of `~/.config/`.
